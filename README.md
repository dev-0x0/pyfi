# Wi-Fi Deauthentication Tool - (Currently undergoing refactoring)

This tool:
- Uses a curses terminal UI (Currently undergoing significant refactoring)
- Enumerates local wireless access points and clients
- Allows for selection of access points or clients for deauthentication from the wireless network
- Allows for various other attacks (e.g MITM)

DISCLAIMER:

This is a project I have created for educational purposes only.
I do not condone nor encourage malicious use of this tool.
Do not use this tool to affect any wireless network unless you have
express permission to do so from the owners and users of the network,
with their full knowledge of the possible effects.
Doing so may result in legal ramifications for you.
